The Organizer Discord bot is designed to make saving messages easy. From saving funny messages from friends to saving images generated by Midjourney, there is a way to save.

## Commands
- `/auto [channel] [user] [tag]`: Initiates autosaving of messages for a specific user.
- `/help`: Displays detailed information about how to use the bot's commands.
- `/save [channel_to_save_to] [message_identifier]`: Saves a specified message.
- `/stop [user/tag]`: Discontinues message tracking for a specific user or all users. If you only use `/stop`, it stops ALL of your tracking.
- `/delete [tag]`: Delete a tag from the database.
- `/tracking`: Lists all users whose messages are being tracked by you.

## 📝Note
This bot was designed with the primary purpose of saving and organizing images created by the AI powered Midjourey bot.
